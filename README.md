# TP Coding Exercise

## Instructions
- Use the Reddit API to query r/aww and implement infinite scrolling with a list of results.
- On initial page load, the app should automatically retrieve the first 25 records.
- When you scroll to the end of the list, load 25 more records.
- Each list item should display the title, thumbnail if available, and the original subreddit name. Clicking the title should navigate to the original reddit post.
- Choose whichever sorting you'd like (top, new, etc).
- You must use at least two different components (ex: reddit-list-item, reddit-list-container.)
- You can use any framework you prefer, do not use any other external libraries or plugins to create the infinite scroll logic or any other interactive mechanics
- include installation and running instructions, host the solution on a git-supported platform (github, bitbucket etc)
